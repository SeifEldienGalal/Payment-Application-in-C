# Payment-Application-in-C
This repository contains code for simulating a Payment System that covers four key transaction types: SALE, REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID. The project simulates interactions between a card, an ATM terminal, and a server to provide a practical understanding of how payment systems process different transactions.
