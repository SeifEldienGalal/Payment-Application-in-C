# Payment-Application-in-C
This repository contains code for simulating a Payment System that covers four key transaction types: SALE, REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID. The project simulates interactions between a card, an ATM terminal, and a server to provide a practical understanding of how payment systems process different transactions.



# Project Overview
Payment systems are essential in daily transactions, supporting various types such as SALE, REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID. This project implements all four transaction types to simulate real-world scenarios of how money flows between a card, terminal, and server.

# Transaction Types Explained
SALE: Deducts a specified amount from the cardholder’s account for a purchase.
REFUND: Reverses a previous transaction, returning money to the cardholder’s account.
Pre-Authorization: Temporarily holds an amount of money on the cardholder’s account, often used for services like hotel reservations.
VOID: Cancels a transaction, typically used to correct errors like an incorrect transaction amount.
# Key Features
Complete Transaction Flow: Simulates SALE, REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID transactions between the Card, ATM Terminal, and Server.
Simulated Components: Models the interaction between a Card, ATM Terminal, and Server, enabling a realistic transaction experience.
Educational Focus: Provides hands-on understanding of transaction types and how payment systems manage them.
